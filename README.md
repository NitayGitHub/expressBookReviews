# Hands-on Lab: Book Review Application
In this final project, I built a server-side online book review application. I integrated it with a secure REST API server which will use authentication at session level using JWT. 
Furthermore, I enhanced the code using Promises, Callbacks, and Async/Await functions to allow multiple users to interact with the application simultaneously without waiting for each otherâ€™s operations to complete.

(run "npm install --save" to download the necessary packages)
