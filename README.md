# Hands on Lab: Book Review Application
In this final project, I built a server-side online book review application and integrate it with a secure REST API server which will use authentication at session level using JWT. 
Furthermore I enhanced the code using Promises, Callbacks and Async/Await functions to allow multiple users to interact with the application simultaneously and not have to wait for each otherâ€™s operations to complete.
